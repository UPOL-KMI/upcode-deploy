# Usage:
#   ./pull-repos.sh                      # use repos.lock (the verified revisions)
#   USE_SSH=1 ./pull-repos.sh            # clone the forks over SSH, so you can push from them
#   NO_LOCK=1 ./pull-repos.sh            # ignore the lock; take each repo's default branch
#   REF=v1.2.3 ./pull-repos.sh           # pin every repo to one tag/branch/commit
#   ISOLATE_REF=upcode ./pull-repos.sh   # per-repo override, for working on a fork
#
# Precedence, highest first: <REPO>_REF, REF, repos.lock, the repo's default branch.

# **Everything is cloned over HTTPS by default, and SSH is opt-in.** Every repository here is
# public, so HTTPS needs no credential of any kind -- which is what a server has: no key, no agent,
# nobody at the keyboard to answer a host-authenticity prompt. Defaulting to SSH made the very first
# command of the installation guide fail on a fresh machine with `Permission denied (publickey)`,
# after the three mirrors had already cloned, which reads like a broken script rather than a missing
# key.
#
# `USE_SSH=1` switches the repositories we commit into back to SSH, because an HTTPS remote cannot
# be pushed to without a credential helper -- it fails with "could not read Username for
# 'https://github.com'" from a clone that otherwise looks correctly set up. So: deployments read
# over HTTPS, developers who push pass the flag once. `set_origin` below re-points an existing
# clone either way, so switching costs nothing.
