# ReCodEx — Docker deployment

This directory packages the [ReCodEx](https://github.com/ReCodEx) programming-assignment
evaluation system (Charles University) as a self-contained Docker Compose stack. ReCodEx
itself ships **no official Docker support** — the upstream deployment method is RPM
packages on Fedora/RHEL. Everything here (Dockerfiles, entrypoints, config templates,
compose file) was written from scratch against the upstream source and tested end-to-end
against a running stack.

`repos/` is not committed — run `./pull-repos.sh` to fetch it (see below). Everything under
`services/` and `docker-compose.yaml` **is** meant to be committed and is what you transfer
to the production server.

### Sources are pinned, and most of them are ours

The ReCodEx components are fetched from **our forks** in the
[`UPOL-KMI`](https://github.com/UPOL-KMI) organisation, named `upcode-<component>`, at the exact
commits listed in **`repos.lock`**. That file exists because fetching each repository's default
branch is a moving target: a stack that worked last week could stop working after a `git pull`
nobody thought of as a change, and there was nowhere to look up what had been working.
**`COMPATIBILITY.md`** is where what-was-verified lives, including the things that are known not to
work yet and the path out of each.

In every fork, `master` is an untouched mirror of upstream and our work lives on `upcode`. Only
`api`, `worker` and `isolate` have that branch; `broker`, `monitor` and `cleaner` are unmodified
mirrors. The legacy frontend `web-app` was never forked and, since 2026-09-17, is not fetched or
built either — `web-next` replaces it and running both meant a second frontend on the same API.

Overrides, highest precedence first:

```bash
./pull-repos.sh                      # the verified revisions, from repos.lock
USE_SSH=1 ./pull-repos.sh            # clone the forks over SSH, so you can push from them
ISOLATE_REF=upcode ./pull-repos.sh   # one repo from a branch, for working on a fork
REF=master ./pull-repos.sh           # everything from one ref
NO_LOCK=1 ./pull-repos.sh            # ignore the lock, take default branches
```

`repos/web-next` is **not** a ReCodEx repo at all — it's our own from-scratch Next.js
replacement for the legacy frontend, developed in its own separate git repository
(`UPOL-KMI/upcode-web-ui`). `pull-repos.sh` fetches it into the same gitignored
`repos/` tree as the upstream repos, purely for convenience — one script still brings the whole
stack together. It builds and runs as the `web-next` service and, since plan 004, **is what the
`proxy` serves at `/`** — it is the frontend, not a preview beside one.

`repos/web-next` is meant to be developed in directly, and so now are `repos/api`,
`repos/worker` and `repos/isolate` — they are our forks, and a push from a shallow clone is refused
outright, which is why those three are cloned in full rather than shallow. Re-running
`./pull-repos.sh` only moves them if there are no uncommitted changes and no local commits missing
from the remote; otherwise it leaves the working tree untouched and tells you so, rather than
discarding in-progress work. The remaining three (`broker`, `monitor`, `cleaner`) are pure build
inputs: shallow, and always forced to the pinned revision.

**Everything clones over HTTPS by default**, because every repository here is public and a server
has no SSH key, no agent and nobody at the keyboard to answer a host-authenticity prompt. If you
intend to *push* from `repos/api`, `repos/worker`, `repos/isolate` or `repos/web-next`, run it once
as `USE_SSH=1 ./pull-repos.sh` — an HTTPS remote cannot be pushed to without a credential helper.
The script re-points an existing clone's `origin` on every run, so switching either way costs
nothing.

                                      talks to `api` directly over the internal network; see
                                      "Layout" above)
```

`api`, `broker`, and `worker` all embed the public domain into URLs they generate for each
other. Inside `docker-compose.yaml` the `proxy` service is given a network alias equal to
`APP_DOMAIN`, so this resolves correctly over the internal Docker network without needing real
DNS to be live yet — useful for testing before you've pointed a domain at the server.

**Except where a worker fetches files, which has its own address.** `API_INTERNAL_ADDRESS`
(default `http://proxy/api`) is what core-api puts in the job a worker picks up, and what the
worker uploads its results to. The alias trick cannot cover this case: with `APP_DOMAIN=localhost`
there is nothing to alias — `localhost` in a container is that container — and every submission
fails to download with "Couldn't connect to server". On a deployment with a real domain the two
addresses may be the same; they are separate variables so that they *can* differ.

## Quick start

```bash
./pull-repos.sh              # fetch the pinned sources (see repos.lock) into ./repos
cp .env.example .env         # then edit .env: passwords, JWT_SECRET, APP_DOMAIN, SMTP...
docker compose build         # ~5-10 min the first time (compiles worker/broker/isolate from source)
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f api   # watch first-boot migrations/seed
```

For local testing, add `127.0.0.1  recodex.local` (or whatever you set `APP_DOMAIN` to) to
your `/etc/hosts`, then open `http://recodex.local/`.

First boot seeds an admin account (`admin@admin.com` / `admin`, controlled by
`RECODEX_SEED_DB=true` in `.env`) — **log in and change that password immediately**, or set
`RECODEX_SEED_DB=false` before first boot and create your own admin via `db:fill` manually.

## The sandbox needs cgroup v2

The `worker` container runs submitted code inside [`isolate`](https://github.com/ioi/isolate)
(the same sandbox IOI/CMS use), which needs direct access to the kernel's cgroup and namespace
facilities — hence `privileged: true` and `cgroup: host` in the compose file.

**We run isolate 2.7, which requires cgroup v2** (the unified hierarchy). That is the default on
current Debian/Ubuntu/RHEL and on Docker Desktop, so in practice there is nothing to configure:
this stack works on a stock modern host, including a Mac.

ReCodEx vendors isolate **1.8.1**, which is the mirror image — it supports only cgroup **v1** — so
on a current host it refuses to run and every submission resolves to an infrastructure failure
rather than a verdict. That is why `repos/isolate` is our fork
([`UPOL-KMI/upcode-isolate`](https://github.com/UPOL-KMI/upcode-isolate), branch `upcode`) carrying
upstream 2.7 instead. Nothing of ReCodEx's own was lost in the move; see
`docs/plans/001-cgroup-v2-local-evaluation.md`.

Isolate 2.x also wants a delegated subtree of the cgroup hierarchy. On a systemd host that is what
its own `isolate.service`/`isolate.slice` units do; in a container there is no systemd, so
`services/worker/docker-entrypoint.sh` creates `/sys/fs/cgroup/isolate` and enables the `memory`,
`cpu` and `cpuset` controllers on it at start-up, and the worker's isolate config points `cg_root`
there. It is created in the **host's root** cgroup rather than under the container's own, because
cgroup v2 forbids a non-root cgroup from holding processes while enabling controllers for its
children and the container's cgroup holds the worker. If that setup fails the entrypoint fails the
container, deliberately: a worker that cannot sandbox would report rubbish verdicts to students,
whereas one that is visibly down gets noticed.

Check the current mode with `mount | grep cgroup` — a cgroup v2 host shows a single `cgroup2` mount
at `/sys/fs/cgroup`. And after `docker compose up -d`:

```bash
docker compose logs worker | grep -E "cgroup v2 subtree|cgroup support"
```

**If you are on a cgroup v1 host** (an older distro, or one deliberately booted with
`systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0`), isolate 2.x will not run and the answer is to pin
`repos.lock`'s `isolate` entry back to `master` — ReCodEx's 1.8.1 — and revert the worker's
`--cg-timing` removal. Upstream ships 1.10.1 for exactly this case.

## Language toolchains

`services/worker/Dockerfile` installs `gcc`, `g++`, `python3`, the **.NET 8 SDK** (C#) and a
**JDK** (Java) by default, and `services/worker/config.yml.template`'s `headers.env` advertises
the matching environments: `bash`, `c-gcc-linux`, `cxx-gcc-linux`, `python3`, `cs-dotnet-core`,
`java`. ReCodEx itself supports more (Rust, Go, Haskell, Node, Kotlin, Prolog, Free Pascal,
Groovy, Scala...) — see [ReCodEx/runtimes](https://github.com/ReCodEx/runtimes) for the full
catalogue and "To add a language" below.

### ⚠️ C#: the .NET version is not free to choose

`cs-dotnet-core-2024-12-15.zip`'s own `Program.runtimeconfig.json` pins
`"tfm": "netcoreapp8.0"` / `"version": "8.0.0"` and sets **no** `rollForward` key, so the host's
default policy (`Minor`) will start on any 8.0.x runtime but will **not** cross to .NET 9 or 10.
Installing "the latest .NET" therefore produces a worker that looks correctly provisioned and
fails every C# submission at run time. (Confusingly, the package's own *description* text still
says "currently v6" — the config file shipped in the same zip is what actually gets loaded, and
it says 8.) The pin lives in `services/worker/Dockerfile`'s `DOTNET_CHANNEL` build arg; change it
only together with the runtime package.

The same pipeline compiles with Roslyn's `csc.dll` through the `dotnet` CLI and requires
`/opt/dotnet` plus *relative* symlinks named `latest` under `sdk/` and
`shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` — the Dockerfile creates both. `.NET` first-run/telemetry writes
are steered away from the wiped-per-submission sandbox `$HOME` by the `DOTNET_*` variables in
`services/worker/config.yml.template`.

**`python3` is 3.13, not Debian 12's stock 3.11.** Bookworm's own `python3` package is 3.11,
which rejects syntax students routinely write when developing against a newer interpreter
(e.g. PEP 701 same-quote-character nested f-strings, valid since 3.12) — that would fail
every submission using it with a bare `SyntaxError`, regardless of whether the logic is
correct. `python:3.13-slim` is built on Debian *13* (trixie); copying its binaries into this
bookworm-based image risks a glibc mismatch, so the worker Dockerfile instead compiles
CPython 3.13 from source in the builder stage (skipping `--enable-optimizations`, a 30+
minute PGO build that isn't worth it for grading short student submissions) and symlinks it
over `/usr/local/bin/python3` (which precedes `/usr/bin` on Debian's default `PATH`). `pytest`
and `pytest-console-scripts` are installed for this interpreter via pip (not the
`python3-pytest` apt package, which targets 3.11) — see the "Python 3.13" block in
`services/worker/Dockerfile` if you need to bump the version later.

**A "runtime environment" in the UI needs two things to actually work**: the worker image
must have the toolchain installed, *and* the core-api database needs a matching
`RuntimeEnvironment` + pipeline pair (the pipeline is what actually defines the
compile/run/judge steps — without one, the environment shows up in the exercise-config
dropdown but grading has nothing to execute). `db:fill`'s fixtures only ever provide the
former half (bare rows, no pipelines) for a fixed list that doesn't match what's installed
anyway, so this deployment does not use them; instead `services/api/Dockerfile` bakes in a
curated set of [ReCodEx/runtimes](https://github.com/ReCodEx/runtimes) packages (bash,
c-gcc-linux, cxx-gcc-linux, python3, cs-dotnet-core, java — matching the worker's toolchains
exactly — plus `data-linux`), and `docker-entrypoint.sh` imports them (`runtimes:import`)
alongside the `init` fixtures on first boot.

**`data-linux` is the one that needs no toolchain**, and it is what makes this usable for work
that is not code. It accepts **any** file (`extensions: ["*"]`) and runs no compiler and no
student program: the only thing executed is a judge the exercise author uploads, through
`/usr/bin/recodex-data-only-wrapper.sh`. That judge is **not optional** — with the `custom-judge`
variable left empty the wrapper tries to execute the sandbox directory itself and every submission
comes back `FAILED` with `/box/: Is a directory`. For "collect the file, grade it by hand", the
judge is two lines that echo a message and `exit 0`; the submission then scores 1.0, the message
appears in the judge log, and the teacher awards the real points through the review screen.

**The instance is named from `.env` on that same first boot.** Upstream's `init` fixture calls it
"Frankenstein University, Atlantida", which is ReCodEx's own test data; `RECODEX_INSTANCE_NAME`
(and the optional `RECODEX_INSTANCE_DESCRIPTION`) is what a deployment calls itself instead. The
entrypoint applies it right after `db:fill init`, and **only when the database holds exactly one
instance** — which is true of a freshly seeded one and stops being true later, so an existing
deployment is renamed through the admin screens rather than by editing `.env`.

To add a language: install its toolchain in `services/worker/Dockerfile`, add the matching
environment name to `headers.env` in `services/worker/config.yml.template`, download the
matching package from the [generic/](https://github.com/ReCodEx/runtimes/tree/main/generic)
folder into the `curl` loop in `services/api/Dockerfile`, then `docker compose build` and
(on an already-seeded instance) run `docker compose exec api php bin/console runtimes:import
--yes /opt/recodex-runtimes/<new-package>.zip` once by hand — the entrypoint only auto-runs
imports on a brand new (unseeded) database.

## What to ask for when requesting a VM

Measured on a running instance of this stack, not estimated.

| | minimum | recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vCPU | 4 | **8** |
| RAM | 4 GB | **8 GB** |
| Disk | 50 GB | **100 GB** |

**CPU.** `threads: 1` in the worker config means one submission is evaluated at a time, each up to
30 s of wall time, so one core is effectively reserved for it and the rest serves PHP-FPM, MySQL,
Node and nginx. Raising `threads` to *N* needs *N* more cores and *N* times the sandbox memory.
More important than the count: **ask for dedicated cores, not shared vCPU on an oversubscribed
host** — time limits are measured in wall time, and a core contended by somebody else's VM gives
students spurious timeouts that nobody can reproduce.

**RAM.** All eight containers idle at about 485 MB together, measured 2026-09-17 (MySQL 126,
web-next 113, broker 107, api 62, api-worker 41, monitor 19, proxy 15, worker 3). Under load
MySQL's buffer pool and the FPM pool grow, and each running evaluation is capped at **1 GiB** by
`limits.memory` in the worker config.

**Disk.** The images come to about 6.2 GB, of which the worker alone is 2.8 GB (it carries the
language toolchains, including a Python built from source). Budget roughly 10 GB for the OS, 25 GB
for images and build cache — building the worker image is the demanding part — and the rest for
data: the database, submitted solutions and result archives, which grow by a few GB a year for a
few hundred students.

**Two things that are easy to leave out of the request and hard to add afterwards:**

- The worker runs `privileged: true` with `cgroup: host` (see *The sandbox needs cgroup v2*), which
  some hosting policies forbid. Say so explicitly, and **ask for a real VM (KVM) rather than an LXC
  container** — isolate cannot create its cgroups inside a nested container.
- Outbound SMTP. Without it no notification is ever delivered; faculty networks often block 587 and
  expect a relay.

## Scaling workers

Add more worker instances by copying the `worker` service block in `docker-compose.yaml`
under a new name (e.g. `worker2`) with a distinct `WORKER_ID`. Each needs its own
`worker_cache` volume. Workers can also run on entirely separate physical machines pointed
at the same broker (`BROKER_URI: tcp://<broker-host>:9657`) and API
(`API_ADDRESS: https://<your-domain>/api`) — that's the deployment ReCodEx was actually
designed for.

## TLS / HTTPS

`services/proxy/nginx.conf.template` listens on plain HTTP by default. To enable HTTPS:

1. Get a certificate (e.g. via `certbot`) for `APP_DOMAIN`.
2. Mount it into the proxy container (uncomment the certs volume line in
   `docker-compose.yaml`) and uncomment the `listen 443 ssl` block in the nginx template.
3. In `.env`, set `PROTOCOL=https`, `MONITOR_PROTOCOL=wss`, `NOTIFIER_PORT=443`,
   `HTTPS_PORT=443` and rebuild `api`/`broker`/`worker` (they bake these into generated
   config at container start, no rebuild needed — just `docker compose up -d` again).

## Known upstream compatibility fixes applied

The `api` image build (`services/api/patch-compatibility.php`) patches a few things in
`repos/api` at build time, all against current `master` rather than any deliberate
misconfiguration on our side:

1. ~104 pre-2022 auto-generated migrations call `getDatabasePlatform()->getName()`, a method
   `doctrine/dbal` 4.x (pinned by upstream's current `composer.lock`) removed entirely —
   rewritten to the DBAL-4-recommended `instanceof AbstractMySQLPlatform` check.
2. Some of those same migrations mix DDL (`ALTER TABLE`) with an explicit
   `beginTransaction()`/`commit()` pair in a `postUp()`/`postDown()` hook — MySQL/MariaDB's
   implicit commit on DDL desyncs Doctrine's transaction-nesting bookkeeping from this,
   crashing with `SAVEPOINT ... does not exist`. Fixed by disabling the transactional wrapper
   (`isTransactional(): false`) and dropping the now-redundant explicit begin/commit calls,
   per Doctrine's own documented escape hatch.
3. `app/commands/runtimes/RuntimeImport.php` (the `runtimes:import` CLI command, see
   "Language toolchains" above) declares its own `-s`/`--silent` option, which collides with
   a `--silent` option the console `Application` itself already registers globally on the
   current `symfony/console` version — `LogicException: An option named "silent" already
   exists.`, thrown before the command ever runs. Fixed by dropping the redundant local
   declaration; the command's own `$input->getOption('silent')` still resolves against the
   global one.

On top of that, a handful of the historical migrations issue `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE` on
columns that are part of a foreign key, which current MariaDB refuses even with
`FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0` (this one doesn't have a clean per-statement fix). Rather than
patching around 8 years of schema evolution one incompatibility at a time, a **fresh**
database is bootstrapped by generating the schema directly from the current Doctrine entity
mappings (`orm:schema-tool:create`) and marking the full migration history as already
applied — see the `serve` branch of `services/api/docker-entrypoint.sh`. An **existing**
database (anything with a `doctrine_migrations` table already) instead runs the normal
`migrations:migrate`, so upgrades of an already-running install are unaffected by any of
this. `mysql` is also pinned to `mariadb:10.11` (LTS) rather than the floating `mariadb:11`
tag for the same reason (issue #1 above reproduces on every MariaDB version tested, 10.11
through 11.7+, since it's a dbal-version issue, not a MariaDB-version one — 10.11 was picked
as a conservative, long-supported baseline, not because newer MariaDB doesn't work).

## Updating

```bash
./pull-repos.sh               # bump repos.lock first, and COMPATIBILITY.md after verifying
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
The `api` container runs `migrations:migrate` on every boot (a no-op if nothing's new), so
schema updates that ship in a future upstream release apply automatically.

## Backups

Two volumes hold everything that matters: `mysql_data` (the database) and `api_storage`
(uploaded exercise/solution files, `storage/local` + `storage/hash`). Back these up; every
other volume (`*_log`, `worker_cache`) is disposable/regeneratable.

**A third thing is not in a volume and not in this repository: `.env`.** It carries the database
passwords and `JWT_SECRET`, and it is in `.gitignore` precisely because it should not be here.
Without it the two archives below cannot be restored onto a new machine, and a changed
`JWT_SECRET` signs every existing session out. Keep a copy somewhere that deserves secrets.

`backup.sh` takes both archives, and `restore.sh` puts them back:

```bash
./backup.sh -o /var/backups/upolnicek        # one directory per run, named by the timestamp
./restore.sh /var/backups/upolnicek/upolnicek-2026-09-17_095158
```

`backup.sh` runs against the live stack -- the dump uses `--single-transaction`, so nothing is
locked and nobody is interrupted. It keeps 14 days by default (`--keep N`, `0` to keep
everything), leaves `.env` out unless asked (`--with-env`), and writes a `MANIFEST` recording the
commit and the `repos.lock` pins the data came from. For a nightly run:

```
0 3 * * *  cd /var/www/upolnicek && ./backup.sh -o /var/backups/upolnicek >> /var/log/upolnicek-backup.log 2>&1
```

`restore.sh` **erases the current database and file store** and asks before it does. It leaves
`.env` alone, so restoring in place uses the deployment's own; restoring onto a new machine means
putting `.env` there yourself first.

The file store is archived first and the database second, and restored in the opposite order.
That is not arbitrary: the database is what refers to the files, so a backup interrupted halfway
leaves a file nothing points at (harmless) rather than a row pointing at a file that is not there
(a download that fails forever).

**Test a restore before you need one.** Both scripts check their own work -- a dump with fewer
than ten tables is rejected as not being a database -- but the only proof a backup is restorable
is a restore.
